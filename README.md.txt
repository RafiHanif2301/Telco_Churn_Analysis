### Dataset Summary
- **Total Customers:** 7,043  
- **Columns:** 33  
- **Key Variables:** Contract Type, Internet Service, Monthly Charges, Tenure, Churn Label  
- **Source:** Public Telco Customer Dataset (cleaned & processed manually in Python)

---

### Dashboard Highlights
#### **1. Customer Retention & Churn Drivers**
- Churn rate: **26.54%** overall.  
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** have the highest churn risk.  
- Shorter tenure (<12 months) significantly increases churn probability.  
- About **40% of customers** fall into the *medium churn risk* segment — the ideal target for retention programs.  

#### **2. Service & Product Experience**
- Customers with **1 service only** have the highest churn (**45.7%**), mainly from *Streaming TV/Movie* users (~30% churn rate).  
- Churn decreases significantly as customers use more bundled services (≥2).  
- **Tech Support** and **Online Security** services are associated with higher retention.  
- **Fiber Optic** users show higher churn risk due to value and pricing perception.

---

### Key Insights
1. Churn is **not only driven by price**, but also by **service experience** and **initial product satisfaction**.  
2. **Streaming services** are the main churn trigger for first-time users.  
3. **Service bundling** effectively improves loyalty and satisfaction.  
4. **Medium-risk customers** are the most promising segment for targeted retention efforts.  

---

### Business Recommendations
- **Promote long-term contracts** (upgrade month-to-month users via loyalty offers).  
- **Improve Streaming TV/Movie quality** to reduce first-month churn.  
- **Encourage multi-service bundling** at early customer onboarding.  
- **Target medium-risk customers** with personalized retention programs.  
- **Reevaluate Fiber Optic pricing** or add perceived-value benefits.
